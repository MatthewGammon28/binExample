Here are some examples of my personal coding projects, showcasing my familiarity with various languages.

codeStopwatch.exe:
A C program that is usually run from the command line.
It takes in a console command, runs it one or more times and returns how long it took to execute the command.
Used to test the time complexity of different programs and algorithms.
See: codeStopwatch.c

restartWinEX.exe: (*Be carefull!)
Terminates and relaunches windows explorer.
I use it to manually refresh desktop and folder icons if windows fails to do so automatically.
See: restartWinEX.c

ls.bat:
Allows the user to use the linux "ls" command on windows.
Must be on the system PATH to work correctly.

showMaze.jar:
Takes in a width, height, and optional pixel-width command line arguments.
Usage: java -jar showMaze.jar int int ~int
If only width and height are entered, the program produces a maze using ascii characters.
If a pixel-width is also specified, then the program produces a graphical maze by launching a separate window.

purge.bat: (*Be carefull!)
Used to terminate all running python or java instances based on the arguments.

*Disclamer:
While I use them regularly on my computer, restartWinEX and purge may be harmful to your machine.
I included them as examples and am not responsible for any problems may result from running them.
